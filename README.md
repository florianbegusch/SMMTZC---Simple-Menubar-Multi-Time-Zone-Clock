I am always trying to keep track of at least four different time zones, and I'd like to be able to look at these at a glance, so here's this simple menubar app to display it. Honestly, I can't believe displaying multiple clocks in the menubar isn't a built-in function in MacOS, but oh well. 
** Not updated since 2017 nor tested in any version of MacOS released after that. Written in Swift 3.0 and no longer compiles in current versions of Xcode (past 10.1 I believe)
