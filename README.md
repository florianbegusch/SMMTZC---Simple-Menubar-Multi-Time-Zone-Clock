# SMMTZC---Simple-Menubar-Multi-Time-Zone-Clock
A simple menubar application to show the time in different time zones. 
SMMTZ was born out of the need for an easy way to glance at the time in multiple timezones.
The standard MacOS clock shows only one time zone, but what if you frequently communicate with people in two time zones? Or three? 

SMMTZ was originally written in Swift 3 while I was serving in the Peace Corps in Indonesia, but frequently communicating with family and colleagues in North Carolina, New Mexico, and South Korea. I was not a talented Swift developer then, and I am not a telented Swift developer now - I'm just using it to solve this problem for myself. 

SMMTZ has recently been updated from Swift 3 to Swift 5 and several features are broken or not implemented. 

Are you a more talented Swift developer than me? Feel free to contribue!
